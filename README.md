## Overview

Fake news is a significant problem in today’s digital world, spreading misinformation and causing confusion. This project focuses on building a predictive model to classify news articles as `fake` or `real` using machine learning techniques and text processing methods.

## Features

- Data preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Easy-to-use scripts for training, testing, and deploying the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains labeled news articles categorized as `fake` or `real`. Popular datasets like the [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data) or others can be used. The dataset should be in CSV format and include columns for the news text and labels.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-prediction.git
   cd fake-news-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` folder.
   - Update the dataset path in the code if necessary.

2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```

3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. Test the model:
   ```bash
   python test_model.py
   ```

5. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

## Model Training

The model training pipeline includes:

1. Text preprocessing:
   - Removing stopwords and punctuation
   - Tokenization and stemming
   - Converting text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization

2. Training multiple classifiers to compare performance:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Multinomial Naive Bayes
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

3. Saving the best-performing model for deployment.

## Results

Key metrics used to evaluate model performance:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the ability to identify all positive instances.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Results will be displayed in the console and saved as visual plots in the `results/` folder.

## Future Work

- Integrate deep learning techniques like LSTM and BERT for improved accuracy.
- Develop a web application for real-time news verification.
- Expand the dataset with multilingual support.
- Implement unsupervised methods for clustering and topic modeling.
